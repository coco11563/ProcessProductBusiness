Constraints can be derived from multiple directions, and we use three distinct strands; (i) direct observations of GRBs and their host galaxies, (ii) parameters derived from modelling, both via population synthesis and direct numerical simulation and (iii) our understanding of plausible analog progenitor systems observed in the local Universe. From these joint constraints, we describe the likely routes that can drive massive stars to the creation of long GRBs, and our best estimates of the scenarios that can create compact object binaries which will ultimately form short GRBs, as well as the associated rates of both long and short GRBs. We further discuss how different the progenitors may be in the case of black hole engine or millisecond-magnetar models for the production of GRBs, and how central engines may provide a unifying theme between many classes of extremely luminous transient, from luminous and super-luminous supernovae to long and short GRBs.

The last two decades of exoplanet discoveries have revealed that exoplanets are very common and extremely diverse in their orbital and bulk properties. We now enter a new era as we begin to investigate the chemical diversity of exoplanets, their atmospheric and interior processes, and their formation conditions. Recent developments in the field have led to unprecedented advancements in our understanding of atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets and the implications for their formation conditions. We review these developments in the present work. We review in detail the theory of atmospheric chemistry in all classes of exoplanets discovered to date, from highly irradiated gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths, to directly imaged giant planets at large orbital separations. We then review the observational detections of chemical species in exoplanetary atmospheres of these various types using different methods, including transit spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and direct imaging. In addition to chemical detections, we discuss the advances in determining chemical abundances in these atmospheres and how such abundances are being used to constrain exoplanetary formation conditions and migration mechanisms. Finally, we review recent theoretical work on the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets, followed by a discussion of future outlook of the field.

Protoplanetary disks are the environment where these dust grains need to grow at least 13 orders of magnitude in size. Our understanding of this growth process is far from complete, with different physics seemingly posing obstacles to this growth at various stages. Yet, the ubiquity of planets in our galaxy suggests that planet formation is a robust mechanism. This chapter focuses on the earliest stages of planet formation, the growth of small dust grains towards the gravitationally bound “planetesimals”, the building blocks of planets. We will introduce some of the key physics involved in the growth processes and discuss how they are expected to shape the global behavior of the solid content of disks. We will consider possible pathways towards the formation of larger bodies and conclude by reviewing some of the recent observational advances in the field.

The initial atmospheres of planets can mainly be related via two formation scenarios. If a protoplanetary core accretes mass and grows inside the gas disk, it can capture H2, He and other gases from the disk. When the gas of the disk evaporates, the core that is surrounded by the H2/He gas envelope is exposed to the high X-ray and extreme ultraviolet flux and stellar wind of the young host star. This period can be considered as the onset of atmospheric escape. It is shown that lower mass bodies accrete less gas and depending on the host stars radiation environment can therefore lose the gaseous envelope after tens or hundreds of million years. Massive cores may never get rid of their captured hydrogen envelopes and remain as sub-Neptunes, Neptunes or gas giants for their whole life time. Terrestrial planets which may have lost the captured gas envelope by thermal atmospheric escape, or which accreted after the protoplanetary nebula vanished will produce catastrophically outgassed steam atmospheres during the magma ocean solidification process. These steam atmospheres consist mainly of water and CO2 that was incorporated into the protoplanet during its accretion. Planets, which are formed in the habitable zone, solidify within several million years. In such cases the outgassed steam atmospheres cool fast, which leads to the condensation of water and the formation of liquid oceans. On the other hand, magma oceans are sustained for longer if planets form inside a critical distance, even if they outgassed a larger initial amount of water. In such cases the steam atmosphere could remain 100 million years or for even longer. Hydrodynamic atmospheric escape will then desiccate these planets during the slow solidification process.		153	211	FWF NFN, FWF, Russian Science Foundation, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Startup Fund of the Ministry of Education of China, Tsinghua University, PNP-CNRS-INSU	H.

But there are hot debates on whether CSR pays off, and how does CSR contribute to firm value remains unclear. The direct test of the relationship between CSR and firm value seems to be imprecise and spurious since it may be influenced by many indirect factors. This study aims to demonstrate whether corporate social responsibility is positively or negatively associated with firm value, and to specify the mechanisms of the relationship from a media attention perspective. The manufacturing industry in China provides the background for this study. To test the proposed hypotheses, data was gathered for manufacturing firms listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange from 2011 to 2013. Empirical results indicate that CSR performance is positively related to firm value, and that media attention has a mediating effect between CSR and firm value.

As investors became more concerned about information justice, the study of the relationship between corporate negative information disclosure and their stock market returns is of practical significance. In this study, the stock market’s reaction to information self-disclosure of safety accidents is investigated multi-dimensionally for Chinese listed firms, including variables such as timing of information release, firm ownership, industry type, media attention to the accident, and the number of deaths. Based on 130 industrial accidents announcements made by publicly listed firms in China from 2007 to 2014, we use the event study method to investigate the extent to which the stock market responds to the safety accidents announcements. The relationship between accumulative abnormal return and its impact factors is examined by multivariate analysis. The results indicate that the stock market reacts negatively after the self-disclosure of work safety accidents. Our results also suggest that several factors—timing of information release, firm ownership and industry type, have significant effects on firms’ reactions in terms of market value.

Aiming at relieving the population ageing, two-child fertility policy was implemented this year. The effect of new fertility policy is urgent to be checked. The system dynamics model is established on the basis of Song Jian population development equation, then simulation experiments are made for testing the new fertility policy. The results show that total population will peak at 1.448 billion in 2022 and reduce to 0.961 billion in 2050 under the regulation of the new fertility policy. However, population structure can only be moderate optimized, cannot be solved essentially. Furthermore, according to the comparative analyses among three different possible fertility policies, the two-child fertility policy enacted in china is verified to be reasonable. Finally, the sensitivity analysis on the willingness of having the second child of fertile women is made. Therefore, some specific measures are proposed as important suggestions for the fertility policy tracking.

This paper aims to discuss the issues about the duration of hot topics: which factors influence the duration of a hot topic on a social media platform? To answer this question, Cox regression model of survival analysis was introduced to make empirical analysis. The survey data containing 60 hot topics from 2011 to 2013 was collected from a popular social media platform of China. Besides, model verification is implemented to validate the adopted model and the calibrated parameters. As a result, this paper finds that the number of participants and opinion leaders have a significant positive influence on an incident’s duration, and official response times have a significant negative impact; whereas, the number of attending media has no significant impact. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy in the validation is up to 85 %, which implies that the obtained results would be robust. The established model and the designed empirical analysis are demonstrated to be adaptable to analyze the duration of hot topics, and three factors are found to effect the duration of a hot topic based on our collected dataset. Our analytic method could also be adopted in numerous problems related to the duration issues in the field of information management.

It is argued that highly tolerant society is prone to accept creative workers’ distinctive behaviors and accommodate their creative needs in science and technology. In this regard, examining the associations between creative worker concentrations and social tolerance should provide important references for urban governors who want to achieve sustainable economic growth through innovation. This paper develops a set of social diversity indicators as proxy for tolerance, and applies geographically weighed regression (GWR) to characterize the associations between creative worker concentrations and social tolerance at district level in Shenzhen, China. GWR identifies spatial non-stationary associations between CCCs and social diversity. More specifically, CCCs have positive correlations with income, education and housing diversity; and the correlations are stronger in districts within the Special Economic Zone (SEZ). CCCs are positively correlated with ethnic and birth place diversity within the SEZ, while opposite correlations are found in districts outside the SEZ. The identified spatial non-stationary relationships may partially answer for the controversial empirical conclusions in earlier case studies. Our study expands the understanding of intra-urban creative worker concentrations in relation to social tolerance. It is believed to provide empirical figures to test the social theory on creative economy.

When we computed the helicity parameters from the SFT data, we replaced the values of the longitudinal field component, transverse field strength, and transverse field azimuth angle with those from the SMFT data and examined the differences. The results show that the correlation coefficient and the fraction of the data that agree in signs of h c $h_{\mathrm{c}}$ or α av $\alpha_{\mathrm{av}}$ increase when an SFT parameter is substituted by the corresponding SMFT parameter because one source of discrepancy is removed. The increase in correlation coefficient is largest when the azimuthal angles and transverse field strengths are set identical in the two instruments; the correlation coefficient of h c $h_{\mathrm{c}}$ ( α av $\alpha_{\mathrm{av}}$ ) increases from 0.74 (0.56) to 0.86 (0.78), respectively, indicating that the differences in the transverse field strength and its azimuthal angle are the largest source of discrepancy in the values of h c $h_{\mathrm{c}}$ or α av $\alpha_{\mathrm {av}}$ . We found a nonlinear relationship in the components of the magnetic field between the two instruments for some data samples; we conclude that this is due to the discrepancy in the calibration procedure between the two instruments. This nonlinearity can be another source of difference in determining helical parameters between the two instruments.

First, H α $\mbox{H}\upalpha$ short fibrils spreading in the pre-formed filament channel joined into longer threads. The joining process was found to be accompanied by small-scale brightening activity, indicating the possible involvement of magnetic reconnection. The forming filament was thickened by merging the neighboring dark threads that were nearly parallel to the axis and also those adjacent to its main endpoints. The formed filament as a single coherent structure only existed for tens of minutes, immediately followed by the dissipation. The dissipation appeared to start with expansion of the filament body, ascending and stripping away of the filament threads, and mass drainage along the legs of the filament. The formation–dissipation process of the filament was repeated three times within the four-hour observational window of Hinode. These observations indicate that the filament structure is highly dynamic. This study provides the observational evidence to confirm the hypothesis of Martin et al. (Ann. Geophys. 26, 3061, 2008) on the irreversible build-up of magnetic fields in the corona by discrete threads or groups of threads ascending bodily into the corona.

It encouraged various non-wave models and played an important role in convergence of the opposing viewpoints toward the recent consensus that there are two types of EUV waves. However, it was recently discovered that a stationary wave front can also be generated when a fast-mode wave passes through a magnetic quasi-separatrix layer (QSL). In this article, we perform a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulation of the interaction between a fast-mode wave and a magnetic QSL, and a stationary wave front is reproduced. The analysis of the numerical results indicates that near the plasma beta ∼ 1 ${\sim}\, 1$ layer in front of the magnetic QSL, part of the fast-mode wave is converted to a slow-mode MHD wave, which is then trapped inside the magnetic loops, forming a stationary wave front. Our results imply that we have to be cautious in identifying the nature of a wave, since there may be mode conversion during the propagation of the waves driven by solar eruptions.

It is found that the time evolution of the turnover frequency is inversely proportional to the time profiles of the radio flux in all bursts. Based on the nonthermal gyrosynchrotron theory of Ramaty (Astrophys. J. 158, 753, 1969), the local magnetic field strength and the electron spectral index are calculated uniquely from the observed radio spectral index and the turnover frequency. We found that the electron energy spectrum is very hard (spectral index 1 – 2), and the time variation of the magnetic field strength is also inversely proportional to the radio flux as a function of time in all bursts. Hence, the time evolution of the turnover frequency can be explained directly by its dependence on the local magnetic field strength. The high turnover frequency (several tens of GHz) is mainly caused by a strong magnetic field of up to several hundred gauss, and probably by the Razin effect under a high plasma density over 10 10 cm − 3 $10^{10}~\mbox{cm}^{-3}$ in the maximum phase of these bursts. Therefore, the extremely flat microwave spectrum can be well understood by the observed high turnover frequency and the calculated hard electron spectral index.

For a total of 1607 days, representing 3 % $3~\%$ of the total interval considered, either SA or SN had a value of zero while the other parameter did not. These occurrences most likely reflect the report of short-lived spots by a single observatory and subsequent averaging of zero values over multiple stations. The main results obtained are as follows: i) The number of spotless days around the minimum of a solar cycle is statistically negatively correlated with the maximum strength of solar activity of that cycle. ii) The probability distribution of SA generally decreases monotonically with SA, but the distribution of SN generally increases first, then it decreases as a whole. The different probability distribution of SA and SN should strengthen their non-linear relation, and the correction factor [ k $k$ ] in the definition of SN may be one of the factors that cause the non-linearity. iii) The non-linear relation of SA and SN indeed exists statistically, and it is clearer during the maximum epoch of a solar cycle.

The TSIM has a pointing system to perform solar tracking using a sun sensor. The TSI is measured by two electrical substitution radiometers with traceability to the World Radiation Reference. The TSI value measured with the TSIM on 2 October 2013 is 1364.88 W m − 2 $1364.88~\mbox{W}\,\mbox{m}^{-2}$ with an uncertainty of 1.08 W m − 2 $1.08~\mbox{W}\,\mbox{m}^{-2}$ . Short-term TSI variations recorded with the TSIM show good agreement with SOHO/VIRGO and SORCE/TIM. The data quality and accuracy of FY-3C/TSIM are much better than its predecessors on the FY-3A and FY-3B satellites, which operated in a scanning mode.

This polarimetric observation was performed from 516.3 nm to 532.6 nm using a prototype Fiber Arrayed Solar Optical Telescope (FASOT). A polarimetric noise level on the order of 10 − 3 $10^{-3}$ results from a reduced polarimetric optical switching demodulation (RPOSD) procedure for data reduction. It is revealed that the modality of fractional linear polarization profiles of the green coronal line shows a diversity, which may indicate complex mechanisms. The polarization degree can approach 3.2 % above the continuum polarization level on a scale of 1500 km, and the nonuniform spatial distribution in amplitude and polarization direction is found even within a small field of view of 7500 km. All of this implies that the coronal polarization is highly structured and complex even on a small scale.

Tacrolimus (FK506), a clinically used immunosuppressive agent isolated from many Streptomyces, is produced by fermentation in industry. Here we chose FK506 as an example to review recent progress in improving FK506 production, including enhancing transcription levels of biosynthetic genes, accelerating post-translational modification levels of biosynthetic enzymes, increasing activities of rate limiting enzymes, and rational supplement of limited precursors. FK506 production was increased from 25 % to sevenfold by these synthetic biology approaches.

When a loss of function occurs in the LG, a significant reduction in tear production and dry eye disease (DED) may occur. A mammalian LG is a secretory gland consisting of acini and ducts. The interaction between epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells plays a major role during development and the self-restoration process of the gland. Some factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 10 and bone morphogenetic protein 7, are associated with these processes. Though several strategies for LG regeneration have been established, there is still a long way to go before there is clarity about LG stem cells. In this review, current knowledge on LG development, LG self-repair, DED and correlative regeneration therapies are summarized.

Here, we present data from three well-dated peat cores that reveal the history of wetland C accumulation in the Sanjiang Plain (China), and its links to Holocene climate and environmental changes. Regional C accumulation was largely governed by monsoon-driven depositional conditions. Before ~4400 cal year BP, the strong summer monsoon favored development of lakes with relatively slow and stable C accumulation rates, ~20 g C m−2 year−1. Thereafter, with the sharp decline in summer monsoon precipitation, peatlands began to form at the expense of the paleolakes, leading to a roughly sixfold increase in the C accumulation rate. This was a consequence of the higher primary production in peatlands compared to lakes. During the interval from 4400 to 500 cal year BP, the gradually increasing C accumulation rate responded to the decreasing strength of the summer monsoon. The decline in C accumulation rate over the past 500 years is attributed to both the strengthened summer monsoon and intensified human influences.

10933	Journal of Paleolimnology	0921-2728	1573-0417	56	2	10.1007/s10933-016-9904-4	An n-alkane and carbon isotope record during the last deglaciation from annually laminated sediment in Lake Xiaolongwan, northeastern China	2016-7-14	The last deglaciation is of great interest because Northern Hemisphere climate has gone through several abrupt changes. We present an n-alkane and compound-specific carbon isotope record of the last deglaciation from the annually laminated sedimentary sequence of Lake Xiaolongwan, northeastern China. The n-alkane distribution suggests that the sparsely distributed vegetation prior to 14.7 ka BP, changed to wood plants and aquatic macrophytes in the early Bølling-Allerød, and was followed by a broadleaved deciduous forest after 11.4 ka BP. In this forest region, where the vegetation is dominated by C3 plants, the compound-specific δ13C value of the long-chain n-alkanes (nC27, nC29 and nC31) is interpreted as a proxy of effective precipitation, while temperature might play a minor secondary role. The positive δ13C27–31 values during the Bølling-Allerød suggest a dry-warm climatic condition, while the negative δ13C27–31 at 13.0–11.4 ka BP indicates a cold-wet climate during the Younger Dryas in this region. Two periods with lower δ13C27–31 occurred at 16.1–16.5 and 17.3–17.7 ka BP and could be associated with the Heinrich event-1a and the Heinrich event-1b, respectively. The synchroneity between the biomarker time series in Lake Xiaolongwan and the δ18O record from the Greenland ice core suggest the dominance of high latitude processes on regional monsoon evolution from the last glacial, the Bølling-Allerød, the Younger Dryas to early Holocene. Regionally, the Okhotsk High might have played an important role for abrupt changes during the glacial/interglacial transition.

The lowest lake level, from 18.5 to 15.0 cal ka BP, may reflect both less glacial meltwater and less precipitation entering the lake. Glacial meltwater generally increased from 15.0 to 7.2 cal ka BP and decreased after 7.2 cal ka BP, whereas precipitation generally increased from 15.0 to 10.2 cal ka BP, decreased from 10.2 to 7.2 cal ka BP, then remained stable and moderate to the present. Comparisons of our results with records in adjacent areas and beyond suggest that the glacial meltwater supply during the past 15 cal ka corresponds well with changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), which are driven by summer insolation at millennial time scales, whereas the precipitation does not match well with ISM changes during the Holocene. Therefore, paleohydrological processes at Lake Pumoyum Co have shown complex responses to climate change. Overall, our results emphasize that reconstruction of paleohydrological processes of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau should be carried out with caution because of glacial meltwater input.

Using sedimentary evidence and absolute age constraints, Wang et al. (J Paleolimnol 51:303–312, 2014) suggested that this lake formed in the early 20th century, perhaps as a consequence of a landslide associated with the 1927 Gulang M8 earthquake. I present evidence to question this hypothesis. Historical records show the lake has been in existence since at least AD 842, i.e. long before the 20th century, and thus its origin is unrelated to the 1927 Gulang earthquake. Documented damage from that shock supports my claim.

In the study region, a 1000-m increase in altitude results in a ~0.75‰ decrease in δ13C and a ~2.2‰ increase in δ15N. Organic carbon stable isotope (δ13C) values of the dominant modern vegetation species, surface soils, and the core samples taken in the swamp exhibit a strong terrestrial C3 plant signature. Comprehensive analysis of the core indicates both terrestrial and aquatic sources contribute to the OM in sediment. Temperature and precipitation are most likely the critical factors that influence δ13C: warm and wet conditions favor lower δ13C, whereas a dry and cool climate leads to higher δ13C values. Higher δ15N values may result from greater water depth and increased primary productivity, promoted by large inputs of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, induced by high surface runoff. Lower δ15N values are associated with lower lake stage and reduced productivity, under drier conditions. Therefore, stratigraphic shifts in these stable isotopes were used to infer past regional climate. Measures of δ13C and δ15N in deglacial deposits, in combination with total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) concentrations, the TOC/TN ratio, coarse silt and sand fractions, dry bulk density and low-frequency mass magnetic susceptibility, reveal two dry and cold events at 15,400–14,500 and 13,000–11,000 cal a BP, which correspond to Heinrich event 1 and the Younger Dryas, respectively. A pronounced warm and wet period that occurred between those dry episodes, from 14,500 to 13,000 cal a BP, corresponds to the Bølling–Allerød. The δ13C and δ15N data, however, do not reflect a warm and wet early Holocene. The Holocene optimum occurred between ~8000 and 6000 cal a BP, which is different from inferences from the nearby Dongge cave stalagmite δ18O record, but consistent with our previous results. This study contributes to our understanding of climate-related influences on δ13C and δ15N in OM of lake sediments in South China.

Aquatic organisms, however, may display heterogeneous responses because of differences in their ecological sensitivity, and/or because of ecological consequences caused by strong interactions among multiple stressors. We applied paleolimnological methods to compare patterns of algal and invertebrate response to multiple stressors in a large, shallow lake in southwest China over the last two centuries. Our multi-proxy records show a clear trajectory of lake eutrophication (greater total nitrogen) and increasing lake productivity (greater sediment Chlorophyll-a concentration) during the last century. Nutrient enrichment and lake productivity played significant, but different roles, in structuring diatom and cladoceran assemblages, accounting for 31.4 and 77.3% of the total variance in the communities, respectively. Furthermore, there was a pronounced influx of the endemic diatom species Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica Skuja, which was strongly associated with the second axis of a diatom PCA (Principal Component Analysis). This occurred synchronously with a documented reversal of hydrological connectivity with a downstream, nutrient-poor lake during the early twentieth century, suggesting a role for species dispersal in modulating community reorganization. There are also strong differences between the two organism groups in their sensitivity to hydrological fluctuations, as hydrodynamics, indicated by sand content, was a significant driver for cladocerans (>25%), but showed only minor influence on diatom assemblages in our selection of minimum adequate models. The proportion of the total variance explained by our measured variables (<30%) was much lower for diatom assemblages than for both cladoceran assemblage and accumulation data (~77%), reflecting differences in community reorganization between the two biological indicators. The sediment-based evaluation of community responses revealed the differential impact of eutrophication and hydrological fluctuations on the biota of this large, shallow lake. Therefore, multiple biological indicators should be evaluated in limnological surveys to assess the full scope of ecological changes in highly stressed lake systems targeted for conservation or restoration.

However, types and depositional mechanisms of the sandstone have not yet been fully studied. In this study, we analyzed modern beach bars in Qinghai Lake, the largest modern lake in China. The key factors controlling beach bar development in the lake were found to be wave length and height, lakeshore terrain, and material supply. Sedimentary models were established based on modern coastal dynamic theory. Beach bars were divided into breaking and surf bars. Breaking bars develop near the breaking zone where water depth is a function of wave height and length. Maximum breaking bar thickness is calculated from the difference between breaking point depth and breaking wave height. Surf bars develop in the surf zone where surf water depth equals breaking wave height. Maximum surf bar thickness is given by the breaking wave height. Wind waves play an important role in the location and construction of Qinghai Lake beach bars.

A multiresolution decomposition was applied over three different types of terrain: flat homogeneous terrain, suburban terrain and urban terrain, with results indicating that, (1) the average scale contribution of u, v, w and $$T_{v}$$ T v had a similar variability with length scale for all these three sites respectively, and the dimensionless length scale corresponding to the maximum sensible heat flux contribution increased with the terrain complexity; (2) the length scale corresponding to the maximal average scale contribution for vertical wind velocity $$\lambda _w $$ λ w was directly proportional to the roughness length $$z_{0}$$ z 0 in unstable conditions; and (3) the contributions of large-scale motions led to sensible heat fluxes determined with a large-aperture scintillomter being larger than those using the eddy-covariance method for the suburban case, whereas this phenomenon was not substantial for the urban case.

The model is driven only by prescribed surface heat fluxes and horizontal pressure gradient forcing. Parametrizations for all physical processes except for turbulence and transport in the PBL are turned off in the simulations to ensure the discrepancies in the simulated PBL flow are due only to differences in the PBL schemes. A large-eddy simulation (LES) of the evolution of a daytime PBL is performed as a benchmark to examine how well a PBL parametrization scheme reproduces the LES results, and performance statistics are compared to rank those schemes. In general, hybrid local and non-local schemes such as the Yonsei University and Asymmetrical Convective Model (version 2) schemes perform better in reproducing the LES results, particularly well-mixed features, than do local schemes. Among local schemes, the University of Washington scheme produces the results closest to the LES. Local schemes, such as those of Mellor–Yamada–Janjic and Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–Niino, simulate too low an entrainment flux, while PBL heights diagnosed from the simulations using local schemes are lower than those from the LES results. Hybrid local and non-local schemes are more sensitive to vertical grid resolution than local schemes. With a higher vertical resolution in the PBL, the schemes using the eddy-diffusivity and mass-flux methods perform better. Differences in the values of eddy diffusivity, length scale, and turbulence kinetic energy and their vertical distributions are large.

Using six fair-weather days of lidar and tower data under clear to cloudy skies, we evaluate the ability of the Doppler lidar to probe the urban boundary-layer structure, and then propose a composite method for estimating the diurnal cycle of the PBL depth using the Doppler lidar. For the convective boundary layer (CBL), a threshold method using vertical velocity variance $$(\sigma _w^2 >0.1\,\hbox {m}^{2}\hbox {s}^{-2})$$ ( σ w 2 > 0.1 m 2 s - 2 ) is used, since it provides more reliable CBL depths than a conventional maximum wind-shear method. The nocturnal boundary-layer (NBL) depth is defined as the height at which $$\sigma _w^2$$ σ w 2 decreases to 10 % of its near-surface maximum minus a background variance. The PBL depths determined by combining these methods have average values ranging from $$\approx $$ ≈ 270 to $$\approx $$ ≈ 1500 m for the six days, with the greatest maximum depths associated with clear skies. Release of stored and anthropogenic heat contributes to the maintenance of turbulence until late evening, keeping the NBL near-neutral and deeper at night than would be expected over a natural surface. The NBL typically becomes more shallow with time, but grows in the presence of low-level nocturnal jets. While current results are promising, data over a broader range of conditions are needed to fully develop our PBL-depth algorithms.

The characteristic scales of intrinsic mode functions vary between different stratifications. The second-order Hilbert marginal spectra display clear separation between fine-scale turbulence and large-scale motions. After removing the large-scale motions, the statistical characteristics of the reconstructed signals confirm the distinction of different stratifications in the fine-scale range. The correlation coefficient analyses reveal that the Hilbert spectral analysis method separates turbulence from large-scale motions in the stable boundary layer.

Separate eddy-covariance systems installed at two levels on a 36-m tower located on a rooftop were operated simultaneously, and observations grouped into two sectors (A, B) according to the prevalent wind directions. For sector A, where the nearby buildings are all below the lower measurement level, the sensible heat and momentum fluxes are generally greater at the upper level. For sector B, where several high-rise buildings are located upwind, the sensible heat and momentum fluxes at the upper level are close to those at the lower level. The analysis shows that the turbulent eddy characteristics differ between the two wind sectors, leading to a different behaviour of turbulent exchange between the two levels. A hypothesis is proposed that addresses the vertical variation of turbulent fluxes in the urban roughness sublayer (RSL). For sector A, the buildings block the flow, change the trajectory of scalars, and distort the footprint of scalar fluxes; this ‘blocking effect’ is believed to lead to a smaller sensible heat flux above the canopy layer. Such an effect should decrease with height in the RSL, explaining the increase of the observed turbulent heat flux with height. In addition, the presence of non-uniform building heights adversely affects turbulence organization around the canopy top, and likely elevates the inflection point of the mean flow to a higher elevation close to the upper measurement level, where larger shear results in a larger momentum flux. For sector B, wake effects from the nearby high-rise buildings strongly reduce turbulence organization at higher elevations, leading to similar sensible heat and momentum fluxes at both measurement levels.

Hence, various algorithms have been proposed for addressing the problems of small sample size with dramatic variations in illuminations, poses and facial expressions in face recognition. Among these algorithms, the virtual sample generation technology achieves promising performance with reasonable and effective mathematical function and easy implementation. In this paper, we systematically summarize the research progress in the virtual sample generation technology for face recognition and categorize the existing methods into three groups, namely, (1) construction of virtual face images based on the face structure; (2) construction of virtual face images based on the idea of perturbation and distribution function of samples; (3) construction of virtual face images based on the sample viewpoint. We carry out thorough and comprehensive comparative study in which different methods are compared by conducting an in-depth analysis on them. It demonstrates the significant advantage of combining the virtual sample generation technology with representation based methods.

Typically, such empirical sensor models are used in sensor calibration and fault monitoring systems. However, simultaneous optimization of related performance metrics, i.e., auto-sensitivity, cross-sensitivity, and fault-detectability, is not a trivial task. Learning procedures for parametric and other relevant non-parametric empirical models are sensitive to optimization and regularization methods. Therefore, there is a need for active learning strategies that can better exploit the underlying statistical structure among input sensors and are simple to regularize and fine-tune. To this end, we investigated the greedy layer-wise learning strategy and denoising-based regularization procedure for sensor model optimization. We further explored the effects of denoising-based regularization hyper-parameters such as noise-type and noise-level on sensor model performance and suggested optimal settings through rigorous experimentation. A visualization procedure was introduced to obtain insight into the internal semantics of the learned model. These visualizations allowed us to suggest an implicit noise-generating process for efficient regularization in higher-order layers. We found that the greedy-learning procedure improved the overall robustness of the sensor model. To keep experimentation unbiased and immune to noise-related artifacts in real sensors, the sensor data were sampled from simulators of a nuclear steam supply system of a pressurized water reactor and a Tennessee Eastman chemical process.

In recent years, renewed attention has been paid to the artificial compound eyes, due to their better characteristics inheriting from insect compound eyes than ordinary optical imaging systems. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art work on artificial compound eyes. This review starts from natural compound eyes to artificial compound eyes including their system design, theoretical development and applications. The survey of artificial compound eyes is developed in terms of two main types: planar and curved artificial compound eyes. Finally, the most promising future research developments are highlighted.

By using both the pseudo label information from target domain samples and the actual label information from source domain samples in the label iterative refinement process, not only the between-class scatter is maximized while that within-class scatter is minimized, but also the original space structure is maintained via Laplacian matrix, and the distribution difference is reduced by using maximum mean discrepancy as well. Moreover, semi-supervised transfer discriminant analysis based on cross-domain mean constraint (STDA-CMC) is proposed. In this algorithm, the cross-domain mean constraint term is incorporated into STDA, such that knowledge transfer between domains is facilitated by making source and target samples after being projected are located more closely in the low-dimensional feature subspace. The proposed algorithm is proved efficient and feasible from experiments on several datasets.

Online observations contain plentiful dynamics information, and ADP algorithms can utilize them to learn the optimal control policy. This paper reviews the research of online ADP algorithms for the optimal control of continuous-time systems. With the intensive study, ADP has been developed towards model free and data efficient. After separately introducing the algorithms, we compare their performance on the same problem. This paper is desired to provide a comprehensive understanding of continuous-time online ADP algorithms.

Specifically, results from a survey of 196 recent graduate students in China indicate that social media use is positively related to employability skills. Internship effectiveness serve as a mediating mechanism through which social media use affects employability skills. Zhongyong has a moderating effect on the social media use-internship effectiveness relationship. In addition to the direct moderating effect, Zhongyong is found to moderate the indirect relationship between social media use and employability skills. We discuss implications of these results for research and practice.
